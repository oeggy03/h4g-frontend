# Buddy4Good

Buddy4Good is platform for both persons with disabilities and able-bodied persons to connect with each other. Buddy4Good encourages the buddying up of an able bodied person (Best Buddy) with a disabled person (Special Friend) to spend time doing activities together. These may be workshops, exercising, bird-watching, or any interest either party may have.


## Set-up for frontend

3. Run `npm install` in the project directory
4. Run `npm start` in the project directory


## Future Plans

- Host the database on Google Cloud SQL rather than MySQL for easier setup
